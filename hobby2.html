<h3>How much do I read?</h3>
The most books I've read in one year is about 60 books. Now that I am in college, I find myself reading less recreationally
because of my workload but it still something I enjoy as a past time. 
<h3>What do I like about reading?</h3>
Reading gives me an opportunity to enjoy some quiet time, either to learn something new or to escape to an imaginary world. I think
reading is valuable because it has the potential to expand one's creative mind and it is also proven to improve writing skills. 
<h3>Some of my favorite books</h3>
Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens <br>
Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen <br>
Scythe by Neal Shusterman <br> 
A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas.
