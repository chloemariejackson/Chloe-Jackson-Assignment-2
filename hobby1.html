<h3>What got me into exercise?</h3>
I started working out in 2020 when I was bored during the pandemic. I have finally started working out consistently for the 2nd year now. It has dramatically
improved my confidence, health, and discipline. 
<h3>What is my workout split?</h3>
As a student, it is important to balance time and health. I try to workout three times a week using a push-pull-legs program to hit all of my muscle groups. 
One day I will workout my back and biceps (pull movements), the other day chest, triceps, and shoulders (push movements), and then I workout my entire legs (quads, glutes, hamstrings, and calves).
I try to incorporate compound movements to make sure I work as many muscles as I can. I also try to walk frequently and stretch before every workout. Exercise helps keep me calm, healthy, and productive.
I like to workout at the <a href= "https://www.recwellness.auburn.edu/">Auburn Recreation and Wellness Center.</a>
